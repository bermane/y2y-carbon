# Quantifying Carbon Benefits across the Yellowstone to Yukon Region

## Introduction

This repository contains all code used in the carbon benefits analysis from Nov 2024 - April 2025. I completed some data retrieval and pre-processing on a local machine, but uploaded all relevant data inputs to Google Earth Engine before running the analysis. I ran the analysis in Google Earth Engine via the python API and jupyter notebooks. 

I split the analysis into three parts:

1. Quantifying carbon stocks
2. Quantifying forest carbon sequestration
3. Quantifying manageable, vulnerable, and irrecoverable carbon

This file serves to describe the structure of this github repository. Details of the analysis itself are in a forthcoming journal article.
